# MIPS
This was an optional project I built for my Computer Architecture class. I was the only one to do it from our entire year :)) since it was optional and got a couple of bonus points to my final grade. I worked on this project during the Easter vacation of my second year. Learned a lot about how a processor works and how does it actually execute the code we write as people. The implementation is based on what we were taught during lectures. My professor was surprized to hear that I didn't use any external materials to built it.

I got so far as to execute a recursive program [fibonacci.s](https://github.com/PetricaP/MIPS/blob/master/MIPS.sim/tests/fibonacci.s) on the processor and presented that to show that the processor works. Would love to put some screenshots, however the program only ran on Vivado which I no longer have.

I also built an assembler for this processor which can be found [here](https://github.com/PetricaP/MIPSAssembler).
